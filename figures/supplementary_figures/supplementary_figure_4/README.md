# H7N9 supplementary figure #4 #


The folowing files contains the raw values used to generate supplemental figure 4. This figure contains all reported read depths across all 8 IAV gene segments for each of the samples that were sequenced for this study. 

TSV_files were used to extract read depth values for each IAV gene segment at each timepoint for each animal, and a custom script was used to generate the summary csv files (matrix) with all the values used for the plots.
